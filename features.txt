PHP Interview Task
Introduction: This is a money transfer business, and the client has asked below features.
Admin Panel: 
Feature 1: In admin panel, the admin should be able to configure which countries he can activate and deactivate as sending and receiving countries.
 For Instance, at one point in the home page of the website we have Sending countries as UK and US then 
 Admin can deactivate any country for eg US from backend and it should reflect at the front end.
  So only one country UK will be shown in the sending countries list.
Similarly, the list of receiving countries should also be configurable from the backend.
Feature 2: In admin panel we would have Static rate and customised rate.
Both are configurable. Customised rate depends on static rate either as value or percentage.
For instance: Sending country is UK and receiving country is India, then the static rate is 100.00 rupees per pound and let's say customised rate is (+ or -) 5 or by % -1
So customised rate is -5 means it should show as 95 in the home page
If it is +5 means it should show 105 in the home page.

Similarly, the sending country is US and the receiving Country Is Pakistan static rate is 286.00 but the customised rate is +3 then on the home page it should show as 289.00 as the conversion rate.
